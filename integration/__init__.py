CTM-Nanochat Integration Package

This package provides tools to integrate Continuous Thought Machines (CTM)
with nanochat for enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Three integration modes:
1. Tool mode: CTM as external tool that nanochat calls via [CTM_*] tokens
2. Adapter mode: CTM as a refinement head on nanochat's hidden states  
3. Hybrid mode: CTM blocks integrated into nanochat's transformer architecture
